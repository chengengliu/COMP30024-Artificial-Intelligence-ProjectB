1. Struture:
	four major modules: AIBoard, AIPlayer, AIStrategy, UtilityFunction
	from these four modules we have the main classes as Player, Board, MinMax Algorithm and its heuristic function
	we save our own game board in Board class, Player has the Algorithm and desicion to make moves and utility function
	gives evalutaion of the algorithm
2. Strategy used in game:
	main structure is formed with minmax alpha-beta prunning algorithm, to find the best possible move a player could do
	heuristic function (or utility function) has a score system based on different aspects: the distance with player piece
	and the chess board center cell, remaining player piece number compare with opponent piece number and the situation a
	player chess piece currrently in.
	from these different evaluation points, we tried our best at securing the victory as taking over the center part of the 
	board as soon as possible while avoid player chess piece being taken out
	at placing phase our technics is a bit more aggressive as we seek the opportunity to take out opponent piece while we try
	to take over the center part of the board
